# Hello Hackers

First module from pwn.college based on execution of commands.

# Intro to Commands

The challenge description mentioned that running the 'hello' command would return the required flag.

After logging into the challenge via SSH, the prompt displays as: 'hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$'.

Similar to how 'whoami' is executed by typing it into the prompt and pressing enter, typing 'hello' and pressing enter retrieves the flag: 'pwn.college{sr40jWrcdLnVz3detjgOaqPDm6O.ddjNyUDLwQjN0czW}'.


# Intro to Arguments 

In this example, arguments are provided after the command, separated by a 'space'.

Since the challenge specifies that the 'hello' command should be run with the argument 'hackers', entering 'hello hackers' into the prompt retrieves the flag: 'pwn.college{s1-Bb000G0QDdRa6QxPO3rNMc5z.dhjNyUDLwQjN0czW}' .
